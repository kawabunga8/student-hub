-- Establishes public.courses as the single canonical course/class catalog,
-- replacing the parallel public.classes (student-hub/toc-dayplans) and
-- rcs.courses (rcs-report-card-tool) catalogs. Versioned via supersession,
-- same pattern as public.learning_standards: editing a course that's already
-- been referenced creates a new row rather than mutating history.
--
-- This migration is additive only — it does not touch public.classes,
-- rcs.courses, public.enrollments, or rcs.enrollments. Those get migrated
-- and retired in a follow-up migration once this table exists.
